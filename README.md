# JCIP - Java Concurrency in Practice
This is a personal repository to learn a bit about concurrency. My primary
reading for this topic is 'Java Concurrency in Practice' by Addison Wesley.

# Goals
I just want to get a basic idea on the practical concepts of concurrency.

# Why Java?
As a student in electrical engineering I'm not very into Java, but
it seems that for some conceptual learning it's often the 'less
painful' way to get into something new - like concurrency.

A further reason to use Java is the book 'Java Concurrency in Practice'
that has become a standard lecture on this topic. Every CS student
is recommending this book - even the experienced C guys - so I'll give it
a try.
